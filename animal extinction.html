<h1> 1. Giant Panda </h1>
<h3> Giant pandas first became endangered in 1990 due to excessive poaching in the 80s and deforestation, depleting their bamboo food source.Over time ,the Chinese government has worked to conserve giant panda habitat and protect the wildlife within it. Now, 67 panda reserves speckle the country, several of which breed them in captivity and care for the sick or injured. 
Although they are no longer endangered, threats persist which could soon cause the species to become extinct</h3>

<h1> 2. Red Panda </h1>
<h3> Almost 50% of the red pandaâ€™s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. The loss of nesting trees and bamboo is causing a decline in red panda populations across much of their range because their forest home is being cleared.</h3>
